/*

The below record describes as service named 'someService' who had read/write permissions
to the calendar interface with access to all calendar services including the service
excluded service 'Other'. It excludes itself from having it's calendar data read by
other services without a service being explicitly granted permissions to it.
It is identified via a challenge using the key 'somePubKey' before it's actions are
authorized according to permissions listed in perm.
